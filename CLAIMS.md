{1} Produces persistent, localized structures

SPI ≈ 0.05–0.11 (nonzero, stable over 10k ticks)
f_flux ≈ 0.009–0.013 (≈1% of perpendicular directions pass gate)
RLI ≈ 0.41–0.45 (repair concentrated, not uniform)
RGI ≈ 5–7 (repair strongly biased to high-flux voxels)

Dead world:

SPI = 0
RGI = 0
Repair_events = 0

Crystal world:

SPI ≈ near-zero
RGI ≈ ~2
f_flux ≈ ~0.07

{2} Spatially localized

f_flux ≪ 1
RLI < 1
RGI ≫ 1
